# Recursion  
## Like Fibonacci  

1. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)  
2. f(0) = f(1) = 1  
3. The sum of the previous two numbers becomes the next number.  

> Example  
f(5) = f(4) + f(3)  
f(4) = f(3) + f(2)  
f(3) = f(2) + f(1)  
f(3) = f(2) + f(1)  
f(2) = f(1) + f(0)  
f(2) = f(1) + f(0)  
f(2) = f(1) + f(0)
